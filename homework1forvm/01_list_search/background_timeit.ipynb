    "Measuring Python Performance with `timeit`\n",
    "==========================================\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance does not matter, unless it does\n",
    "-------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write a program, you should **not** worry too much about performance during the initial stages of the coding process.\n",
    "The important thing at that stage is writing clear code that is well-documented, easy to maintain, and will be extensible in the future.\n",
    "This goes doubly so for Python: the language isn't exactly a speed demon to begin with, so performance optimizations can only take you so far.\n",
    "That said, if a program runs too slow for its intended usage purpose, you need to find a way to make it faster.\n",
    "And the first step in that process is figuring out which steps of the program take a long time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The right choice of algorithm and data structures can have a huge impact on performance.\n",
    "For example, sets and dictionaries allow for much faster retrieval of items compared to a list.\n",
    "When a list is sorted, binary search is faster than linear search.\n",
    "Or at least that's what the theory says.\n",
    "In practice, you'll want to measure the performance of your program to get some concrete results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `timeit` package\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simplest case\n",
    "\n",
    "The `timeit` package provides an easy way of measuring how long certain computations take.\n",
    "The simplest usage scenario revolves around the function `timeit.default_timer()`, which ask the operating system for the current time.\n",
    "You can store this value in a variable, e.g. `start`:"

    "For the very simple measurements we take in this class, this approach is sufficient.\n",
    "However, it has two major downsides:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have to manually specify the measuring points.\n",
    "1. Unless you add a loop to take multiple measurements, only one measurement will be taken.\n",
    "   This makes the result somewhat unreliable - if your computer is temporarily busy with some other task, fewer resources will be available for Python and some of the code may run more slowly.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this, we have to make better use of the capabilities of `timeit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced usage\n",
    "\n",
    "What we really want is to create a timer object that can carry out and store multiple measurements for us.\n",
    "This is done with the `timeit.repeat` function.\n",
    "But before we look at this, let's consider the simpler case of `timeit.timeit`.\n",
    "This function takes three arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `stmt`: the code to be tested, as a single string\n",
    "- `setup`: the setup code as a single string; this is used to load any packages or definitions that are needed for the test code to run\n",
    "- `number`: how many executions of the test code should be part of a single measurement\n",
